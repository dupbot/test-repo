<title>DupBot - Not useful</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="ffffff">
<h2>Thank you for your input!</h2>
<p> We are researchers at Carnegie Mellon University developing a bot to monitor GitHub projects
    and alert project maintainers to potentially duplicate pull requests. Don't worry; we will not post
    more than one comment per repository.
<p> We would, however, love to know more about why you did not find our comment useful. If you'd be willing to
    help us out by elaborating on your previous answer, you can do so here:
<form>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<textarea name="comment" rows="4" cols="50"></textarea><br>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<input type="submit" value="Submit">
  </form>
<p> Any ideas on how we could improve?
