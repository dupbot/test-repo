<h2>Thank you for your input!</h2>
<p> We are researchers at Carnegie Mellon University developing a bot to monitor GitHub projects
    and alert project maintainers to potentially duplicate pull requests. If you'd like to subscribe
    for more notifications like this, or are interested in our work, continue reading!
<p> This bot is currently in its alpha stage, and we are only sending one comment at most
    to each repository, so our subscription is not up and running just yet. Nevertheless, if you wish
    to subscribe to this service, please provide your information here so
    we can contact you at a later date:
